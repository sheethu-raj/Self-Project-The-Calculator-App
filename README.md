# Self-Project-The-Calculator-App

This is a simple calculator application built using React.js. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app displays the numbers and operations that the user clicks, and upon pressing the equals `(=)` button, the result is calculated and displayed in the input field.

Key Features:

- Dynamic Input Display: As users click buttons, the input field dynamically updates to show the expression being built.
- Real-Time Calculation: When the equals button is pressed, the result is evaluated and displayed in the same input field.
- Clear Functionality: The `Clear` button allows users to reset the input for a new calculation.
- Error Handling: Displays `Error` if an invalid expression is entered or evaluated.

The app is designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional for simple calculations.
